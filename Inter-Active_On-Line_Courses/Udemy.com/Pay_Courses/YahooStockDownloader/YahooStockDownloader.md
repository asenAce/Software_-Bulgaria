C# app to download historical stock quote information (in .CSV format) from Yahoo Finance

Check

Yahoo will only let you download the stock information for one stock at a time on their site, but you can download multiple stocks at the same time with this app.
You can get the data in daily, weekly, or monthly format and then analyze it at your convenience.

This was built for .NET 4 so it will work on 
Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 
as long as .NET 4 is installed.

To get this working, clone this project and open the YahooDownloader.sln file in this folder inside of Visual Studio:
```

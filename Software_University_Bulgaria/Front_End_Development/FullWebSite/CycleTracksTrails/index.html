					Imperial installations and outposts.</p>

				<h4><span>me wrote this on </span></h4>
					<p>Director Antoine Fuqua brings his modern vision to a classic story in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
					Pictures’ and Columbia Pictures’ THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. With the sleepy town of Rose Creek under 
					the deadly control of industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), the desperate townspeople, 
					led by Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett), employ protection from seven outlaws, bounty hunters, gamblers and hired guns
					– Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington), Josh Farraday (Chris Pratt), Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), Jack Horne
					(Vincent D’Onofrio), Billy Rocks (Byung-Hun Lee), Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), and Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). 
					As they prepare the town for the violent showdown that they know is coming, these seven mercenaries find themselves 
					fighting for more than money.</p>

					<p>From Lucasfilm comes the first of the Star Wars standalone films, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” an all-new epic adventure.
					In a time of conflict, a group <strong>of unlikely heroes band</strong> together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire’s u
					ltimate weapon of destruction. This key event in the Star Wars timeline brings together ordinary people who choose to do extraordinary things,
					and in doing so, <em>become part of something<em> greater than themselves.</p>

				<h3>Ojai Trail Facts</h3>
					<p>A battered veteran of the Clone Wars as well as the ongoing rebellion against the Empire, Saw Gerrera leads a band of Rebel extremists.
					Saw has lost much in his decades of combat, but occasional flashes of the charismatic and caring man he once was shine through his calloused exterior. 
					Gerrera is bunkered on the ancient world of Jedha, coordinating a prolonged insurgency against the Imperial occupation. 
					Saw’s ailing health has not withered his resolve to fight.</p>

			<h2>Main Colum Heading</h2>
			<p>This is the main-area speace My intention with this <span class="brand_color">book</span> is to turn your world upside 
		    down, to wake you up, and to open your eyes. 
			After youâ€™ve read it, I sincerely believe that nothing will seem the same to you. 
			Most of what you now believe you 
			know about women will change. Everything that previously made no sense will simply
			fall into place. You may very well see all your past experiences, your 
			current situation, and everything that happens from this day forward in a completely new light. 
			Issues that once concerned you and problems that still concern others will vanish.
			The ideas that I will present have the potential to improve the quality of your 
			life significantly, beyond your wildest expectations, if you allow them to. 
			These ideas also run the risk of upsetting you, so consider yourself warned. 
			The book has not been written to make you feel good, but to help you become better</p>

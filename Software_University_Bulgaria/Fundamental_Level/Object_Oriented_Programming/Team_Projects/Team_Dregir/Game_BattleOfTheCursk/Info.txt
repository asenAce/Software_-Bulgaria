Obviously more work is needed , the tanks attack should be interlaced , I declared few properties that can be applied to few new Methods such as calculating the moving speed
 of the tank depending on what kind off terrene he is situated . more classes could be used like for example class airFighter  with his properties on his own , 
can be created a method attackTheTank , from the air… can be used Interfaces … as the base of the game I used the example in the demo code for Except Handling namely
 “Custom Exceptions” for further development of the game could be used as reference direction the game “Slum”
 there is nice methods for positioning the objects on the screen (x,y) on the ordinate ,also there is nice using of
 the base data structure [] massives and  List<>  separated by switch statement we can use those as well.

The Illuminati is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious.
Historically, the name refers to the Bavarian Illuminati founded on May 1, 1776.
The
societys
goals
were
to
oppose
superstition,
obscurantism,
religious influence
over public life
and abuses
of state power.
In subsequent use,
Illuminati refers to various organisations
which claim or are purported to
have links to the original Bavarian Illuminati
or similar secret societies,
though these links are unsubstantiated.
They are often alleged
to conspire to control world affairs,
by masterminding events
and planting agents in government
and corporations,
in order to gain political power
and influence
and to establish
a
New World Order
.
Central to some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories,
the Illuminati have been depicted
as lurking in the shadows
and pulling the strings and levers of power
in dozens of novels, movies,
television shows,
comics, video games
and music videos.
